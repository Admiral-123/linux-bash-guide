 > overrides the file but >> apends the file 
 < lets us input a file into the command eg: wc -w < txtFile.txt
	the above code gives us the amount of word in text file

<< lets us enter multiple lines for eg:

	cat << EOF > fileName.txt

	in the above code we can write multiple lines   
	 and end with EOF to save the entire file

<<< lets us enter a String, for eg:

	 wc -w << "hello how r you"
	
	the above code gives us the num of words in the String
